Upon a dew drop's kiss 

with rainbow colors so rich,

add a rose and a puppy 

its a match to bewitch. 

A rose;
lazing and grazing, 

all of these days, 

in the morning sun's 
benevolent rays. 

Sharp, prickly thorns, 

and yet
beauty will tell you, 

that's what you get. 

And any prickly thought, 

in the presence of beauty, 

I soon forget.
Sweet as honey, 

the puppy and your lips 

are right on the money, 

as God's breath drips, 

blanketing in the dew. 

In this state
only a kiss will do. 

On such a lovely day 

I must say;
its never hit or miss. 

Just a rose, a puppy 
and a kiss, 

what a perfectly 
delightful tryst.
