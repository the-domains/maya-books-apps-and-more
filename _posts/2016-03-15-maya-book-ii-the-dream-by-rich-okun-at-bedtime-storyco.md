description: "Maya Book II - The Dream Crystal awoke in a rush, rubbing her eyes and looking around for Maya. She found her at the foot of the bed, all stretched out; her warm, furry little body was molded tightly against Crystal's legs. Crystal let out a sigh of relief, and with a contented smile, she lay back down."
